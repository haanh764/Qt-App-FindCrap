I am Nanduni Indeewaree Nimalsiri. Currently, I  am  a  third  year  undergaduate  at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

I have always been passionate about applying engineering principles in the field of Information and Communication   Technology.  Software  Engineering  is  a  field that I found closely tailored to my  personality as it intertwines both computer science and engineering. 

I prefer UX,  web designing  and  mobile  aplications development. I am expressly passionate about exploring novel  technologies related to SOA, Big Data Analytics and Web Services too.

My goal  is  to  become  a  successful  and  a  contented  software  engineer  in  the future . I hope to possess the necessary skills  set  that  is  prudential  for  succeeding  as an engineer in a global market.

I  think  that  my greatest strength is my communication and interpersonal skills which will allow me to  face  any  challenges with ease. I already have experiences as a leader and also as a cooperate team  member  in  various  software  engineering projects,  which I think had helped me to cultivate organizational and management skills to ensure high performance in a work environment.

Further more,  I love  to  play chess and  video games whenever I get time. I love travelling as well. Dancing is something I involve during my leisure time.
